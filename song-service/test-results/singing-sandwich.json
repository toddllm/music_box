  "lyrics": "[verse]\nIt was a Tuesday, dark and cold\nWhen the strangest tale was told\nIn Delilah's Deli down the street\nSomething happened most elite\n\n[verse]\nA sandwich sat upon the shelf\nTalking quietly to itself\nTurkey, lettuce, swiss cheese too\nSinging songs both old and new!\n\n[chorus]\nWho made the sandwich sing?\nWhat a most peculiar thing!\nBread and meat in harmony\nSinging in sweet melody!\n\n[verse]\nDetective Johnson came around\nTo investigate the singing sound\nHe questioned mustard, mayo, pickle\nEach ingredient made him tickle\n\n[verse]\n'I am innocent!' cried the bread\n'I just lie here like I'm dead!\nCheck the turkey, check the cheese\nOne of them must hold the keys!'\n\n[chorus]\nWho made the sandwich sing?\nWhat a most peculiar thing!\nBread and meat in harmony\nSinging in sweet melody!\n\n[verse]\nThe turkey gobbled, 'Not me, sir!\nI'm just protein, I don't purr!\nThe cheese might know, ask him instead\nHe's the one that's yellow-red!'\n\n[verse]\nSwiss cheese shouted through his holes\n'I don't sing, I just have goals\nTo be melted, that's my dream\nCheck the lettuce, crisp and green!'\n\n[chorus]\nWho made the sandwich sing?\nWhat a most peculiar thing!\nBread and meat in harmony\nSinging in sweet melody!\n\n[verse]\nBut then the pickle spoke up loud\n'I think I know what makes us proud\nIt's not one ingredient alone\nBut all of us together grown!'\n\n[verse]\n'When we're stacked up nice and neat\nWe become a singing treat!\nHarmony from every layer\nMakes us quite the sandwich player!'\n\n[verse]\nSo the mystery was solved that day\nThe sandwich sang in its own way\nNot from magic, not from spells\nBut from how good friendship smells!\n\n[outro]\nTogether we can sing!\nWhat a wonderful thing!\nBread and meat in harmony\nFriendship's sweet melody!\nThe sandwich choir of Deli-land\nThe most delicious in the land!",
