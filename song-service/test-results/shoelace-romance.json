  "lyrics": "[verse]\nIn a sneaker dark and deep\nWhere dirty socks do sometimes sleep\nThere lived a lace of brilliant white\nWho dreamed of love both day and night\n\n[verse]\nHis name was Larry, long and thin\nHe'd wrap around through thick and thin\nBut oh, his heart was filled with woe\nFor love, he had nowhere to go\n\n[chorus]\nTie me up, tie me down\nI'm the loneliest lace in town\nThrough the eyelets I must go\nBut love's a thing I'll never know\n\n[verse]\nEach morning when his owner rose\nLarry helped secure the clothes\nHe'd loop and pull with all his might\nBut dreamed of love throughout the night\n\n[verse]\nThen one day in the sporting store\nHe saw a lace worth living for\nHer name was Linda, pink and bright\nShe made his polyester heart take flight!\n\n[chorus]\nTie me up, tie me down\nI'm the loneliest lace in town\nThrough the eyelets I must go\nBut love's a thing I'll never know\n\n[verse]\n'Oh Linda!' Larry called out loud\n'You make me feel so strong and proud!\nWould you consider being mine?\nWe'd make a pair both strong and fine!'\n\n[verse]\nLinda blushed a deeper pink\n'Oh Larry, yes! I truly think\nThat we could be a perfect pair\nThrough rain and shine, we'd always care!'\n\n[chorus]\nTie us up, tie us down\nWe're the happiest laces in town\nThrough the eyelets we will go\nTrue love is all we need to know!\n\n[verse]\nSo Larry left his lonely shoe\nTo be with Linda, pink and true\nThey were purchased by a runner sweet\nWho bound them 'round her dancing feet\n\n[verse]\nNow every day they dance together\nThrough sunshine and through stormy weather\nTwo laces bound by love so deep\nA promise that they'll always keep\n\n[outro]\nTied together, never down\nWe're the happiest laces in town\nThrough the eyelets side by side\nLove and laces, unified!\nForever bound in sweet romance\nLarry and Linda's shoelace dance!",
