  "lyrics": "[verse]\nIn the pumpkin patch so grand and wide\nLives a pumpkin with enormous pride\nHis tummy's big, his tummy's round\nThe biggest belly that can be found!\n\n[verse]\nBum bum bum tum tum tum!\nHere he comes, the tummy's fun!\nOrange and wide, he rolls along\nSinging his tummy-rumbling song!\n\n[chorus]\nI believe! I believe!\nIn the pumpkin's tummy dream!\nBum bum bum tum tum tum!\nGreatest tummy under sun!\nGum fun, gum fun everywhere\nPumpkin's tummy beyond compare!\n\n[verse]\nBut this pumpkin had a secret true\nHe chewed magical gum, pink and blue\nThe more he chewed, the more he grew\nHis tummy expanded, through and through!\n\n[verse]\nGum fun! Gum fun! All day long!\nChewing gum makes pumpkins strong!\nBubble gum and spearmint too\nMakes his tummy dreams come true!\n\n[chorus]\nI believe! I believe!\nIn the pumpkin's tummy dream!\nBum bum bum tum tum tum!\nGreatest tummy under sun!\nGum fun, gum fun everywhere\nPumpkin's tummy beyond compare!\n\n[verse]\nThen one day while chewing hard\nMagical creatures filled his yard\nUni unicorns with horns so bright\nDancing in the pumpkin light!\n\n[verse]\nUni unicorns! Uni unicorns!\nPlaying music with their horns!\nThey saw his tummy, big and round\nAnd made a most enchanting sound!\n\n[chorus]\nI believe! I believe!\nIn the pumpkin's tummy dream!\nBum bum bum tum tum tum!\nGreatest tummy under sun!\nGum fun, gum fun everywhere\nPumpkin's tummy beyond compare!\n\n[verse]\nThe unicorns began to dance\nAround his tummy in a trance\nThey sang about his bubble gum\nAnd how his belly beats like drum!\n\n[verse]\nBum bum bum! The tummy drums!\nTum tum tum! The music comes!\nUni unicorns sing along\nTo pumpkin's belly beating song!\n\n[verse]\nThe pumpkin felt so proud and free\nHis tummy was his symphony\nHe blew a bubble, pink and wide\nWith unicorns dancing by his side!\n\n[verse]\nThe bubble grew and grew and grew\nUntil it lifted him up too!\nFlying high above the ground\nThe biggest tummy, safe and sound!\n\n[outro]\nI believe! I believe!\nDreams can make your heart achieve!\nBum bum bum tum tum tum!\nFlying tummy, here we come!\nGum fun, gum fun in the sky\nUni unicorns flying high!\nPumpkin's tummy saves the day\nBum bum tum in every way!\n\nAnd so the pumpkin learned that day\nThat being different is okay\nHis big fat tummy brought him joy\nLike a magical, round, orange toy!\nBum bum bum tum tum tum!",
