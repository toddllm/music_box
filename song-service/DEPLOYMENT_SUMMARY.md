   - Features: 30-day TTL, UUID primary keys
   - Status: ✅ Active and receiving data

2. **Lambda Functions Updated**
   - Added DynamoDB integration
   - New endpoints:
     - `GET /karaoke/songs` - List all saved songs
     - `GET /karaoke/songs/{id}` - Get specific song
   - Automatic song saving after generation

- Music URL: Active on Fal.ai CDN

### 🌐 Endpoints

- **API Gateway**: https://pd08901pf7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod

- **CloudFront (New)**: https://d2ugsg84qhlo4p.cloudfront.net/karaoke.html (deploying)

### 🎵 How It Works Now

1. **Song Generation**: When any user creates a song, it's automatically saved to DynamoDB
2. **Song Storage**: Songs are stored for 30 days with all data (music URL, lyrics, AI vocals)
3. **Shared Library**: All users see the same pool of generated songs
4. **Play Again**: Click any saved song to replay without regenerating

### 📝 Key Benefits

- **Community Experience**: Users can discover and play songs created by others
- **No Re-generation**: Once created, songs can be replayed instantly
- **Automatic Cleanup**: 30-day TTL prevents unlimited database growth
- **Fault Tolerance**: Falls back to localStorage if server is unavailable

### 🔧 Technical Details

- DynamoDB uses on-demand billing (pay per request)
- Lambda functions have 5-minute timeout for song generation
- Frontend gracefully handles server errors
- All sensitive data stored in AWS Secrets Manager

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. Monitor DynamoDB usage and costs
2. Consider adding song metadata (play count, ratings)
3. Implement search/filter functionality
4. Add user attribution (optional player name with songs)

### 📊 Current Status

- Backend: ✅ Fully operational
- Database: ✅ Accepting and serving songs
- Frontend: ✅ Updated and deployed
- APIs: ✅ All endpoints working
- Song Generation: ✅ ~30 second generation time

The karaoke game now has full server-side song caching, allowing anyone to replay previously generated songs!
